I am a junior undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University.

My research interests focus on grounding language in spatial understanding and robotic manipulation, specifically how computational models can learn from real-world data, uncover the underlying causal relationships, and use this understanding to perform reasoning and decision-making. Ultimately, I aim to explore how these models interact more effectively with the real world and generate positive impacts. 

From June 2024 to January 2025, I conducted research under the guidance of [Dr. Nan Gao](https://nancygao.com/), a Shuimu Scholar postdoc researcher at the [Pervasive HCI Lab](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) of Tsinghua University. I had a wonderful and fulfilling summer at the Pervasive HCI lab, where we addressed issues in family education using LLM and HCI technologies, aiming to infer human behaviors and mental states to improve self-awareness and promote human well-being. Our research represented a novel application of LLMs to directly encode and analyze human behavior through dialogue data, and we innovatively led the way in using LLMs in collaboration with human experts for qualitative coding and analysis of real-world data. We also developed a family education strategies recommendation system for real-world scenarios.


During my second year, I had an enriching research experience in the Information Retrieval Group at Northeastern University [(NEUIR)](https://neuir.github.io/), under the guidance of Associate Professor [Zhenghao Liu](https://edwardzh.github.io/). During this time, I'm dedicated to exploring RAG methods that address the knowledge needs of LLMs. Centered around the concept of augmentation, our research explores from a cognitive science perspective how to effectively leverage external knowledge and the parametric memory of LLM to enhance its capabilities. Specifically, enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities by leveraging self-generated common sense knowledge and reasoning instructions.
