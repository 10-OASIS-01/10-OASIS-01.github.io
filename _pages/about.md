## üìñ Introduction

I was a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of NLP and HCI, focusing on enhancing the interaction between Edge AI models on mobile devices and humans, as well as exploring LLM applications in sports and health.

Currently, I am conducting research under the guidance of [Dr. Nan Gao](https://nancygao.com/), a Shuimu Scholar postdoc researcher at the [Pervasive HCI Lab](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) of Tsinghua University. Together, we are addressing issues in family education using LLM and HCI technologies, aiming to infer human behaviors and mental states to improve self-awareness and promote human well-being.

During my second year, I had an enriching research experience in the Information Retrieval Group at Northeastern University [(NEUIR)](https://neuir.github.io/), under the guidance of Associate Professor [Zhenghao Liu](https://edwardzh.github.io/). During this time, my research focused on Faithful Reasoning of LLM, RAG-sft, QA, and other NLP tasks.
