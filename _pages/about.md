I am a junior undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University. Currently, I have been working as a Research Assistant working on **Embodied AI, Spatial Intelligence and Robotics** under the supervision of [Prof. Yao (Mark) Mu](https://yaomarkmu.github.io/) at Shanghai AI Lab & [ScaleLab, SJTU](https://scalelab-sjtu.github.io/index.html). Meanwhile, I closely collaborate with [Zhixuan Liang](https://liang-zx.github.io/) from MMLab@HKU. Our collaboration focuses on robotic behavior code generation through reinforcement learning in closed-loop physical simulations. 


My research interests mainly focus on：

- **grounding language in spatial understanding and robotic manipulation**,

- **Learning robotic poses and structures in specific task and workspace settings**

**I am looking for a Ph.D. position starting in 2026 Fall. Please feel free to reach out!**

## 📖 Past Research Experiences

### **Tsinghua University – [Pervasive HCI Lab](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/)**  

📅 **June 2024 – January 2025**  
👨‍🏫 **Advisor:** [Dr. Nan Gao](https://nancygao.com/), Shuimu Scholar postdoc researcher, currently associate professor at Nankai University.

- Conducted research on **family education support** by integrating **large language models (LLMs) and human-computer interaction (HCI)** technologies.
- Developed novel methods to **infer human behaviors and mental states** from dialogue data, enhancing self-awareness and promoting well-being.
- Combined **LLM-driven analysis with expert qualitative coding** to process real-world data and built a **recommendation system for family education strategies**.

### **Northeastern University – [Information Retrieval Group (NEUIR)](https://neuir.github.io/)**  

📅 **Second Year Undergraduate**  
👨‍🏫 **Advisor:** [Associate Professor Zhenghao Liu](https://edwardzh.github.io/)  

- Focused on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods** to enhance LLM knowledge capabilities.  
- Explored **cognitive science-inspired augmentation** techniques to integrate external knowledge with parametric memory.  
- Investigated **self-generated common sense knowledge** and **reasoning instructions** to improve LLM reasoning ability.
