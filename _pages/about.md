I am a junior undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University.

My research interests focus on **grounding language in spatial understanding and robotic manipulation**, specifically how computational models can learn from real-world data, uncover the underlying causal relationships, and use this understanding to perform reasoning and decision-making. Ultimately, I aim to explore how these models interact more effectively with the real world and generate positive impacts. 

Currently, I am a research assistant (RA) working on **Embodied AI, Spatial Intelligence and Robotics** under the supervision of [Prof. Yao (Mark) Mu](https://yaomarkmu.github.io/) at [ScaleLab](https://scalelab-sjtu.github.io/index.html), Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Meanwhile, I closely collaborate with [Zhixuan Liang](https://liang-zx.github.io/) from MMLab@HKU.  

## 📖 Past Research Experiences

#### **Tsinghua University – [Pervasive HCI Lab](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/)**  
📅 **June 2024 – January 2025**  
👨‍🏫 **Advisor:** [Dr. Nan Gao](https://nancygao.com/), Shuimu Scholar postdoc researcher, currently associate professor at Nankai University.

- Conducted research on **family education support using LLM and HCI technologies**.  
- Developed methods to **infer human behaviors and mental states** to enhance self-awareness and promote well-being.  
- Proposed a **novel LLM application** to encode and analyze human behavior through dialogue data.  
- Innovatively combined **LLM-based analysis with human expert qualitative coding** to process real-world data.  
- Designed and implemented a **family education strategies recommendation system** for practical applications.  

#### **Northeastern University – [Information Retrieval Group (NEUIR)](https://neuir.github.io/)**  
📅 **Second Year Undergraduate**  
👨‍🏫 **Advisor:** [Associate Professor Zhenghao Liu](https://edwardzh.github.io/)  

- Focused on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods** to enhance LLM knowledge capabilities.  
- Explored **cognitive science-inspired augmentation** techniques to integrate external knowledge with parametric memory.  
- Investigated **self-generated common sense knowledge** and **reasoning instructions** to improve LLM reasoning ability.
