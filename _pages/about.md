I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University, China. Currently, I have been working as a Research Assistant working on **Embodied AI, Spatial Intelligence and Robotics** under the supervision of [Prof. Mingyu Ding](https://dingmyu.github.io) at UNC-Chapel Hill and [Prof. Yao (Mark) Mu](https://yaomarkmu.github.io/) at [ScaleLab, SJTU](https://scalelab-sjtu.github.io/index.html). 


My research interests mainly focus on:
- **Grounding language in spatial understanding and robotic manipulation**
- **Egocentric embodied self-perception of MLLMs**
- **Reasoning and planning in multi-modality and embodied AI systems**
- **Human-Robot Collaborative Interaction in Real-Simulation Hybrid Environments**

My long-term research goal is to develop embodied agents that learn from rich, physically-informed data gathered through real-world interaction. I am dedicated to imbuing these agents with the capacity for causal reasoning and sophisticated decision-making, enabling them to collaborate seamlessly and safely with humans. This pursuit is guided by a core principle: to create technology **with everyone**, **for everyone**, ensuring that advancements in AI provide **accessible assistance** to people from all walks of life.

## 📖 Research Experiences


### **University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill – Research Intern**

**Advisor:** [Prof. Mingyu Ding](https://dingmyu.github.io) · 📅 **June 2025 – Present**, Remote

At UNC, I work on enhancing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with **spatial understanding** and **action-level reasoning** for robotic manipulation, by leveraging **human language instructions** and **interactive guidance in augmented reality (AR) environments**. This research explores how embodied agents can better ground language in physical contexts to perform complex tasks more effectively.

### **Shanghai Jiao Tong University – Research Assistant**

**Advisor:** [Prof. Yao Mu](https://yaomarkmu.github.io) · 📅 **March 2025 – Present**, Shanghai, China

At SJTU, I serve as an equal first author and core contributor of **RoboTwin 2.0**, a scalable benchmark for robust bimanual robotic manipulation. I led the design and implementation of the **robot policy code generation agent**, providing the foundation for robust policy data generation in embodied agents.


### **Tsinghua University – [Pervasive HCI Lab](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) – Research Assistant**

**Advisor:** [A/Prof Nan Gao](https://nancygao.com/), [A/Prof Chun Yu](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/ChunYu/) · 📅 **June 2024 – January 2025**, Beijing, China

At Tsinghua, I developed **LLM-based methods** to infer **human behaviors and mental states** from dialogue data, aiming to enhance self-awareness and promote well-being. I combined **LLM-driven analysis** with **expert qualitative coding** to process large-scale family education data and built a **recommendation system** that provides personalized guidance for parent–child interactions.
