I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University, China. Currently, I have been working as a Research Assistant working on **Embodied AI, Spatial Intelligence and Robotics** under the supervision of [Prof. Mingyu Ding](https://dingmyu.github.io) at UNC-Chapel Hill and [Prof. Yao (Mark) Mu](https://yaomarkmu.github.io/) at [ScaleLab, SJTU](https://scalelab-sjtu.github.io/index.html) & Shanghai AI Lab. Meanwhile, I closely collaborate with [Zhixuan Liang](https://liang-zx.github.io/) from MMLab@HKU and [Weiliang Tang](https://cuhkwilliam.github.io) from CUHK.


My research interests mainly focus on:
- **Grounding language in spatial understanding and robotic manipulation**
- **Reasoning and planning in multi-modality and embodied AI systems**
- **Human-Robot Collaborative Interaction in Real-Simulation Hybrid Environments**

**I am looking for a Ph.D. position starting in 2026 Fall. Please feel free to reach out!**

## üìñ Research Experiences

### **Northwestern University, USA ‚Äì [MLL Lab](https://mll-lab-nu.github.io)** July 2025 ‚Äì Present

**Advisor:** [Prof. Manling Li](https://limanling.github.io)

Embodied multimodal LLM agents (Ongoing).

### **Joint Research Internship ‚Äì UNC-Chapel Hill, Horizon Robotics, SJTU**  March 2025 ‚Äì Present

**Advisor:** [Prof. Mingyu Ding (UNC)](https://dingmyu.github.io), [Yusen Qin (VP of D-Robotics)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yusen-qin-5b23345b/?originalSubdomain=cn), [Prof. Yao Mu (SJTU)](https://yaomarkmu.github.io/) 

In this joint internship, I am empowering multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with spatial understanding and action-level reasoning for robotic manipulation. My contributions include developing robotic behavior code generation pipelines in closed-loop physical simulation environments and creating an LLM-powered Copilot to assist robotic system development for Horizon Robotics.

### **Tsinghua University ‚Äì [Pervasive HCI Lab](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/)**
**June 2024 ‚Äì January 2025**

**Advisor:** [A/Prof Nan Gao](https://nancygao.com/), [A/Prof Chun Yu](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/ChunYu/)  

At Tsinghua, I developed LLM-based methods to infer human behaviors and mental states from dialogue data, aiming to enhance self-awareness and promote well-being. I combined LLM-driven analysis with expert qualitative coding to process real-world data and built a recommendation system for family education strategies.


### **Northeastern University, China**  October 2023 ‚Äì April 2024

**Advisor:** [A/Prof Zhenghao Liu](https://edwardzh.github.io/) 


My research here explored Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to address the knowledge needs of LLMs. I specifically investigated how self-generated common sense knowledge and reasoning instructions could improve the reasoning abilities of large language models.
