I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University, China. Currently, I have been working as a Research Assistant working on **Embodied AI, Spatial Intelligence and Robotics** under the supervision of [Prof. Mingyu Ding](https://dingmyu.github.io) at UNC-Chapel Hill and [Prof. Yao (Mark) Mu](https://yaomarkmu.github.io/) at [ScaleLab, SJTU](https://scalelab-sjtu.github.io/index.html). Meanwhile, I closely collaborate with [Zhixuan Liang](https://liang-zx.github.io/) from MMLab@HKU and [Weiliang Tang](https://cuhkwilliam.github.io) from CUHK.


My research interests mainly focus on:
- **Grounding language in spatial understanding and robotic manipulation**
- **Reasoning and planning in multi-modality and embodied AI systems**
- **Human-Robot Collaborative Interaction in Real-Simulation Hybrid Environments**

My long-term research goal is to develop embodied agents that learn from rich, physically-informed data gathered through real-world interaction. I am dedicated to imbuing these agents with the capacity for causal reasoning and sophisticated decision-making, enabling them to collaborate seamlessly and safely with humans. This pursuit is guided by a core principle: to create technology that is fundamentally **with everyone**, **for everyone**, ensuring that advancements in AI provide **accessible assistance** to people from all walks of life.

## 📖 Research Experiences

### **Northwestern University, USA – [MLL Lab](https://mll-lab-nu.github.io)** 

**Advisor:** [Prof. Manling Li](https://limanling.github.io), 📅**July 2025 – Present**

Embodied multimodal LLM agents (Ongoing).

### **Joint Research Internship – UNC-Chapel Hill, Horizon Robotics, SJTU**  

**Advisor:** [Prof. Mingyu Ding (UNC)](https://dingmyu.github.io), [Yusen Qin (VP of D-Robotics)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yusen-qin-5b23345b/?originalSubdomain=cn), [Prof. Yao Mu (SJTU)](https://yaomarkmu.github.io/), 📅**March 2025 – Present**

In this joint internship, I am empowering multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with spatial understanding and action-level reasoning for robotic manipulation. My contributions include developing robotic behavior code generation pipelines in closed-loop physical simulation environments and creating an LLM-powered Copilot to assist robotic system development for Horizon Robotics.

### **Tsinghua University – [Pervasive HCI Lab](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/)**
