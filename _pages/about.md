I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University, China. Currently, I have been working as a Research Assistant under the supervision of [Prof. Mingyu Ding](https://dingmyu.github.io) at UNC-Chapel Hill and [Prof. Yao (Mark) Mu](https://yaomarkmu.github.io/) at [ScaleLab, SJTU](https://scalelab-sjtu.github.io/index.html). 


My research lies at the intersection of **embodied intelligence**, **multimodal reasoning**, and **human-robot interaction**. I am particularly interested in developing foundation models that ground **language and perception** in real-world physical understanding, enabling robots to reason, plan, and act effectively in complex environments.

* **Language Grounding and Spatial Manipulation:** Connecting structured representations with spatial reasoning and physically grounded robotic actions.
* **Egocentric Embodied Perception in MLLMs:** Studying how multimodal large language models perceive and interpret the world from an embodied, first-person perspective.
* **Multimodal Reasoning and Planning:** Enabling embodied agents to integrate vision, language, and action for structured decision-making and open-world generalization.
* **Human–Robot Collaborative Intelligence:** Designing interactive systems that support safe and adaptive collaboration between humans and robots in real–simulation hybrid environments.

Ultimately, my goal is to build **embodied agents that learn from real-world interactions**, developing **causal reasoning** and **compositional skills** for generalizable mobile manipulation. Guided by the principle of creating technology *with everyone, for everyone*, my research aims to advance **accessible, human-centered AI** that enhances daily life and broadens equitable access to intelligent systems.

## 📖 Research Experiences


### **University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill – Research Intern**

**Advisor:** [Prof. Mingyu Ding](https://dingmyu.github.io) · 📅 **June 2025 – Present**, Remote

At UNC, I work on enhancing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with **spatial understanding** and **action-level reasoning** for robotic manipulation, by leveraging **human language instructions** and **interactive guidance in augmented reality (AR) environments**. This research explores how embodied agents can better ground language in physical contexts to perform complex tasks more effectively.

### **Shanghai Jiao Tong University – Research Assistant**

**Advisor:** [Prof. Yao Mu](https://yaomarkmu.github.io) · 📅 **March 2025 – Present**, Shanghai, China

At SJTU, I serve as an equal first author and core contributor of **RoboTwin 2.0**, a scalable benchmark for robust bimanual robotic manipulation. I led the design and implementation of the **robot policy code generation agent**, providing the foundation for robust policy data generation in embodied agents.
